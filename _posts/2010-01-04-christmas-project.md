I made a little project for some friends and relatives this Christmas... using 
an Arduino microcontroller board, an Altoids tin, and some assorted bits, I 
built a simple interface to a virtual Etch-a-Sketch (written in Processing). 
Two knobs control the up-down and left-right drawing of a line on the computer 
screen; a pushbutton changes the color of the line being drawn; a toggle 
switch changes between keeping the line continuously on the screen, and fading 
out the tail as the head of the line is being drawn. Just like a real 
Etch-a-Sketch, shaking the box erases the screen (using a tilt-switch inside 
the tin.)

This project is really a recyclable gift -- the tin, and the Arduino inside, 
is just a simple interface to the computer; the Arduino is really overkill for 
the purpose, and all the real work is done on the PC side. That means I can 
send my gift recipients new pieces of fun software to run, using the same 
interface box, ***or*** they can send the box back to me when they get bored 
with Etch-a-Sketch, and I can turn the Arduino into something else for next 
Christmas. Or, for some of the giftees, they will discover that they have a 
nifty new platform for developing projects of their own (I provided a CD with 
all the necessary Arduino and Processing tools!)
