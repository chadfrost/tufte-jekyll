<p class="mobile-photo">I was snoozing, and woke up to see a large city 
passing by underneath... 
"why, that looks remarkably like Phoenix" I thought. And indeed it was, 
the city of Nimue's birth, so I took a picture.</p><p

also flew just south of NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center, but the iPhone 
camera, shooting through two layers of airplane window, just does not capture 
well.<p>But Anna and Nim picked me up at the airport, and we walked out of the 
terminal to the sight of a spectacular rainbow -- one expected to see a 
pot of gold at the end!  And if you look closely, you'll see that it's 
even a *double* rainbow.</p>
