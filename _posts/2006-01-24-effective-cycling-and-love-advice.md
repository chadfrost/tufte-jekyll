Effective Cycling: Here's a [great 
intro](http://www.cyclecalifornia.com/Effective.html) to proper road-riding 
skills for urban survival... [John 
Forester](http://www.johnforester.com/index.html) wrote a [giant 
book](http://www.johnforester.com/Articles/bikebooks.htm) on the topic, but 
the author of this page provides a nice summary, and gives a good sense of the 
flavor of the book: "Forester also gives you tips on love. (e.g., Make sure 
your sweetie is a cyclist; noncyclists resent all that time you spend 
riding.)"
