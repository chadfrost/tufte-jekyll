Here's an [album](http://www.zmmquality.org/gallery/albums.php) with pictures 
from Robert Pirsig's original 1968 cross-country motorcyle journey (as told in 
"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance") plus photos from more recent 
re-creations of the trip.  It's cool to see how closely the actual 
people/places are to what I had always pictured in my mind's eye!
