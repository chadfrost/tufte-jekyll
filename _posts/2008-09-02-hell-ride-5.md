So, Mark Weir and Rachel Lloyd pick a crazy route to ride around Downieville, 
and then sucker some poor folks into going with them by holding out a new bike 
as a carrot -- what a great idea! They call it the [Hell 
Ride](http://www.santacruzmtb.com/hellridefive/winners.php). Check out the 
[route and 
stats](http://trail.motionbased.com/trail/episode/view.mb?episodePk.pkValue=6419479) 
-- I can't believe these guys did it in under 8 hours! That's just rippin'. 
Either one of the loops in this course makes for a pretty decent ride.
