We made our way out the Golden Gate and right into the fog - cold,  gray 
and a big Pacific swell. Heading south, we split into two 4-hour  watches 
and made an average of about 4 knots. With the wind nearly  dead astern, 
and wind light and moving about, we had a hard time  keeping the headsail 
filled and elected  to run through the night  under just the 
mainsail.

No one was feeling well in the rolling swell - it was impossible 
to  eat or drink, and the fog made it very cold and damp. By morning, we  
were all wiped out, and decided to take a break.

We came in through the 
fog to Stillwater Cove, which turns out to be  right under the end of the 
famous Pebble Beach golf course! It is nice  and calm and still, we ate 
and slept up and cleaned things up on the  boat. The stars are out and 
magnificent for the moment, until the  marine layer comes back 
in.

We&#39;ll head out in the morning for Port San Luis, which is likely to  
take another 24 hours. Our run yesterday was about 105 miles, which  
wasn&#39;t bad given the conditions.
