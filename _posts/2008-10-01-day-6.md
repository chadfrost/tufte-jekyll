We explored San Miguel Island a bit - took the skiff over to the 
beach, and hiked down the beach, then up a trail to the top of the 
bluff overlooking the bay. Discovered a marker on the bluff 
commemorating the Portugese explorer Joao Rodriguez Cabrillo, buried 
on the island in 1540. Many weird and wonderful plants there, and lots 
of seals sleeping on the beach. A volunteer ranger and his wife were 
hanging out on the beach, and we chatted with them for a bit. They 
come spend a few weeks on the island, and have it mostly to themselves.
