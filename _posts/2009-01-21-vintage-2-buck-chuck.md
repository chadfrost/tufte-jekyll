As an experiment some years back, I socked away a few bottles of [Charles 
Shaw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Shaw_wine) wine. This fine vintage, 
for those unaware, is sold by Trader Joe's, initially for $2.00/bottle -- 
hence the widely-used nickname, "2-Buck Chuck". 

It's actually pretty good, for $2 wine... it costs a little more now, but it's 
still a good value, and perfectly drinkable on such occasions as camping 
trips, boat voyages, and such adventures where more delicate or costly bottles 
might not fare well. 

So. Last week I came across a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon from 1999, and, 
having run out of everything better, I figured now was as good a time as any 
to try it out. Expectations were low, but one never knows... And now: just how 
good *is* a 9-year-old bottle of 2-Buck Chuck? 

Well, not very. It hadn't spoiled (e.g. wasn't vinegar, yet) but it was 
clearly past its prime -- which was, in all likelihood, in 1999. The bottle 
has been relegated to cooking tasks, and will make an excellent contribution 
to "Anna's wine sludge"! 

The next experiment: a blind tasting perhaps, of my carefully-hoarded flight 
of Charles Shaw Merlot, 1997-2003!
