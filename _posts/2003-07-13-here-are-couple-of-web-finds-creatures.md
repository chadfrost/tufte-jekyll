Here are a couple of web-finds: 

<li>[The Creatures in my Head](http://www.creaturesinmyhead.com/) -- doodles 
from the head of Andrew Bell. 

<li>Some pretty good random commentary at [Defective 
Yeti](http://defectiveyeti.com/)... I particularly like [this 
one](http://www.defectiveyeti.com/archives/000479.html) urging the adoption of 
the Lego brick as the standard unit of US currency. 

<li>The [Propaganda Remix](http://homepage.mac.com/leperous/PhotoAlbum1.html) 
project co-opted a bunch of the WW2 posters and re-purposed them for the 
current war... be sure to read the [drooling 
vitriol](http://homepage.mac.com/leperous/Personal4.html) of the far right in 
response to this guy's work!
