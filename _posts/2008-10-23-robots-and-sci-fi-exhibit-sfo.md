There's a [great exhibit](http://www.sfoarts.org/exhibits/f2/f2-%20current.html) in the north 
terminal connector at  SFO, featuring the artifacts of the 50s-60s space 
craze. ([SFO Museums](http://www.sfoarts.org/) has many exhibits of very high 
quality; I've always impressed by them, and I try to take a little extra time 
to look at them when walking through the airport!) This exhibit brought back 
many childhood memories...
