Took care of chores today, walking many miles in the process... Got my 
first latte in 12 days (and oh, it was good!) at Red's cafe. We found 
a new stainless steel air pot for the boat, to replace the glass one 
that fell and broke a few days ago; I got some shorts, Alan wanted an 
iPod, and we experienced full crowd immersion after 11 days of near 
solitude. We found a laundry that we could drop our stuff off at for 
$0.75/lb, which sounded like a bargain! After picking up groceries and 
the laundry, we went to Joe's for dinner - a wonderfully old-fashioned 
place that serve traditionally delicious food, suitable for hungry 
sailor-types.
