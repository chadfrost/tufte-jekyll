The Adventure Cycling Association's [Colorado Alpine 
Expedition](http://www.adv-cycling.org/tours/2006coloradoalpine.cfm) looks 
like fun... 
<blockquote>For each of four days we will ride 30 to 40 miles on dirt roads 
and cross a high alpine pass between 12,000 and 13,000 feet in elevation. Set 
in southwest Colorado’s San Juan Mountains, often described as the 
"Switzerland of America," the route encompasses the legendary Alpine Loop, and 
then includes two additional days of riding above timberline. We’ll overnight 
in the lively and historic towns of Telluride, Silverton, Lake City and Ouray, 
stops that will provide welcome comfort at the end of each big day of 
high-altitude riding.</blockquote>
