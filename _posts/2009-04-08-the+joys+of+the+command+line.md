I've found myself sliding back towards command-line interfaces (CLI) lately... 
it's been more of a slow drift than a sudden shift, and I haven't really given 
it much thought. It's not like I'm [late to the 
party](http://lifehacker.com/software/command-line/geek-to-live--the-command-line-comeback-226223.php), 
exactly -- I *started out* on the command line, and now I'm coming full 
circle, or at least partially so. 

I find I'm much more efficient when I can interact entirely through the 
keyboard -- yes, one must use a pointing device for some kinds of tasks (and I 
love my Space Navigator for flying around Google Earth) but most of my time 
these days is spent reading and writing, in a bunch of different applications 
(list to follow) with little need for mousing *if the interfaces are good*. I 
do make an effort to learn keyboard shortcuts, and for the apps I use a lot 
that has definitely paid off.
