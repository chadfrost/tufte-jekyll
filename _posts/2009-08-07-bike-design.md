According to the annals of cycling lore, a great bike should: 

1. "Disappear" beneath the rider 
2. _Feel_ fast 
3. Not absorb the rider's energy 

These are all highly subjective, qualitative descriptions... but anyone who 
has ridden a bike that can be described this way, remembers the experience. 
What are some of the contributing factors that make such a bike? 
<!--more-->

*Fit.* If the bike doesn't fit the rider 
well, the inconsistencies will constantly distract from the experience; even 
if at the edge of awareness, the (lack of) fit will prevent the rider from 
integrating fully with the bike. 

*Feel.* Assuming the bike fits, it 
should have good "handling qualities." Desirable handling qualities may be 
different depending on the intended use of the bike -- a touring bike needs 
stability more than responsiveness; a criterium bike should respond 
instantaneously; a stage-race bike should be somewhere in between. How the 
bike responds when climbing, descending, cornering, accelerating and braking 
should all be in harmony. These characteristics are principally determined by 
frame and fork geometry, but also by handlebar width, stem length, rider 
size/weight, wheel and tire characteristics... and the list goes on. In 
addition to handling qualities, feel is determined by the ability of the bike 
to absorb road shock and vibration vertically, while not feeling like a wet 
noodle or allowing the front end to feel disconnected from the back. Modern 
frames have been able to make huge progress in this area through the use of 
big headset bearings (1.5" on the bottom now)  and composites, which allow the 
stiffness of the frame to be distributed however the designer wants. 

*Energy transmission.* Back in the day, 
high-quality steel could lend "spring" to a frame; energy put in by the rider 
might be absorbed in frame-flex, but could be returned when the frame 
rebounded. Shaping of tubes, selection of thickness, and such craftsmanship 
could all contribute to an efficient and spritely bike, while avoiding 
something so stiff and/or heavy that it was uncomfortable. With the advent of 
composite frames, the bottom end can be made extremely stiff and efficient, 
while maintaining compliance in the upper frame to give a comfortable ride. 
Either way, steel, titanium, aluminum, bamboo or carbon-fiber, the challenge 
is the same: deliver as much of the rider's energy to the wheels as possible, 
while keeping the bike comfortable (or tolerable, if a race machine) to ride 
on the road surface of choice. 

I offer these observations because I've been riding what I think may be [the 
perfect bike](http://chad-o-matic.blogspot.com/2009/08/perfect-bike.html) (or 
at least, by far the best I've ever ridden, and I've ridden a lot of bikes) 
which has made me think a lot about just what makes it so good. 

That's not to say I don't think there's still room for improvement!  Component 
manufacturers in particular have a lot of room to continue development of 
their products... but that's a thought that really deserves a separate post.
