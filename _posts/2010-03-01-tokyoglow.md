This is quite possibly the coolest art video I have seen in the past year... a 
glowing "walk signal" character takes a stroll through night-time Tokyo, via 
stop-motion video. It's easier to watch it than to try to explain it!

Tip 'o the hat to [Laughingsquid](http://laughingsquid.com/tokyo-glow/) for 
finding it (at [Pink Tentacle](http://pinktentacle.com/2010/03/video-tokyoglow/))!
