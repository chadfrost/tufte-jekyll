Well, pretty much everyone in the Red States and quite a few of those in the 
Blue will loathe me for complaining about this, but: All my pants are now too 
big in the waist by at least an inch, and sometimes two.  It's not like I ever 
had much weight to lose, mind you -- but all the riding this summer has melted 
off what little I had accumulated around the middle, leaving me (a) hungry, 
and (b) looking for belts.  Time to clean out the closet, I suppose.
