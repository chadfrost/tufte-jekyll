Today was the first serious mountain stage in the Tour de France, and I was 
worried that I'd miss it entirely -- I only get broadcast TV, and after being 
spoiled by Mom's satellite TV coverage last weekend, I searched all week for a 
friend with cable and an Outdoor Life Network (OLN) channel subscription!  CBS 
isn't even providing weekend coverage this year, as far as I can tell. 

But eureka -- Lance Armstrong's [website](http://www.lancearmstrong.com/) has 
links to both real-time text updates at 
[Eurosport.com](http://www.eurosport.com/home/pages/L0/S18/E5040/event_Lng0_Spo18_Evt5040.shtml) 
and a [live webcast](http://tour.tv2.dk/live/show.php) from Danish TV!  So I 
was able to see the finish on Mont Ventoux, even if it was in low-res...
