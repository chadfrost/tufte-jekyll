(Note: I re-organized a couple of the posts below -- I somehow skipped Day 6, 
and then numbered the following days wrong. Maybe forgetting what day it is, 
is the sign of a good trip?) 

We sailed from Santa Cruz Island over to Santa Barbara (about 25 nm) under 
delightful conditions -- light wind, brilliant skies, balmy warmth. Had a 
perfect view of the lovely oil platforms cluttering up the coast... We got in 
to the Santa Barbara marina around 5, got a slip and tidied up the boat, and 
got our first showers in many days (oh, that felt sooooo good!) Went to dinner 
with Bradley. Back to the boat for a nightcap and conversation; we got to bed 
around 1 am.
