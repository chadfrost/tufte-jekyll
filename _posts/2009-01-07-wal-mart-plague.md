I saw this first on 
[Gizmodo](http://i.gizmodo.com/5125187/the-terrifying-spread-of-the-walmart-plague), 
but I think it should be mandatory viewing for everyone in the entire flippin' 
world:

Watch as the Green Plague of Mediocrity spreads from its roots in the 
heartland, slowly at first and then with exponential virulence... 

On a broader, non-scary-as-hell note: this was my first visit to 
[flowingdata](http://flowingdata.com), and it's full of interesting stuff with 
a design sense informed by Tufte.  Here is a 
[tidbit](http://flowingdata.com/2008/10/30/tracking-weight-and-what-i-eat-with-twitter-self-surveillance-made-easy/) 
to whet your interest. I also liked his "[5 Best Data Visualization Projects 
of the 
Year](http://flowingdata.com/2008/12/19/5-best-data-visualization-projects-of-the-year/)" 
article.
