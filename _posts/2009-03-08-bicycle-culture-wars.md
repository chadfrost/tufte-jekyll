Some interesting intersections of life and commentary lately: 

Last week, whilst on a ride with Randy and Mike, we stopped for coffee in 
Boulder Creek, charming little hamlet in the Santa Cruz mountains. A fellow 
stopped by and asked if we rode on the local 2-lane road (the only one that 
goes through Boulder Creek) and then launched into an unprompted diatribe 
about how cyclists didn't belong on the road, as they got in his way and 
slowed him down.

Later in the week I came across [this 
article](http://fortunaerota.wordpress.com/2008/10/15/biking-class-and-the-panic-of-2008) 
discussing the issues of how bike riders are perceived by different layers of 
the social strata; the working hypothesis being that spandex-clad roadies are 
thought of by their antagonists as frivolous road-cluttering impediments to 
those who work for a living, who ditched bikes as a mode of transportation as 
soon as they could afford to do so... Although this doesn't account for the 
behavior of the selfish pork-faces driving expensive SUVs around here, the 
article frames the issues of class and cycling nicely, and is a good starting 
point for further thought and discussion. 

And finally, John Murphy just posted [his own 
insights](http://holierthanyou.blogspot.com/2009/03/i-will-not-aplogize-for-reckless.html) 
on why being an apologist for other cyclists' poor behavior is a futile 
disservice to the community, in that it legitimizes the opinion that riding a 
bike (well _or_ poorly) is somehow an abnormal 
fringe activity. 

But I really, really liked how Murph summed it all up: 

> My tactic with anti-bike people is to put them on the defensive 
with the absurd. "These cyclists get in the way of traffic". Answer? "Well, do 
you run them over?". "No". "Why not? They got in your way, get them out of 
your way - run them over". 75% of the time the angry cretin starts to shift 
and look very uncomfortable, this was not the fight they were trying to 
pick.

So, what to make of all this? 

Well, I try my best to ride carefully and responsibly, and not do anything to 
tick off the car drivers... and while I continue to be distressed on an 
all-too-regular basis by drivers who seem out to get me, I've decided that I'm 
going to try harder not to react to them. It's the same logic as dealing with 
bullies: react, and it only reinforces their bad behavior. Give that driver 
the finger after they willfully cut you off, and they'll only feel legitimized 
in having done it; arguing with them at the stoplight about the vehicle code 
won't convert them.
