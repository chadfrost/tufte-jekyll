Here's a map of today's bike ride... a mere 25 miles and 3800 ft of climbing.  
But, I was riding my single-speed bike, with no suspension, not even the fork, 
so it counts for more!  Ah, the joys of single-speed... only those with a 
masochistic streak need apply.  The girl on a single-speed who left me in the 
dust (OK, it was mud) on last week's ride motivated me to ride the thing more.
