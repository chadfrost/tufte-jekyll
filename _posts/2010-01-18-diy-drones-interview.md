I had a great time as the featured guest on the [DIY 
Drones](http://diydrones.com/) 
[podcast](http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/chad-frost-shares-stories-from) 
recently (10 January), talking about future opportunities and applications for 
civilian use of UAVs, as well as NASA's involvement. The community of 
enthusiasts at DIY Drones amazes me with the sophistication and eagerness they 
are bringing to the world of small UAVs -- they truly represent the future.
