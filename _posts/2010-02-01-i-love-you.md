Dear friends and family: I love you all. I really, really do! It's simple 
enough to say, and I don't say it enough. So I want you each to know how much 
I value having you as part of my life. Whether we're riding bikes, going 
camping, drinking beer, doing chores, reminiscing about fun (and challenging) 
times we've had, or thinking about what the future holds: I love you. 

So you might reasonably ask, what spurs me to write such sentimentality on a 
Monday morning? Well, [Heidi 
Swift](http://gritandglimmer.com/haiti-still-needs-our-help/) does. She 
reminds us that the tragedy in Haiti is not finished, and that the Haitians 
still need our help. Heidi has offered to donate $0.10 to relief efforts for 
every one of her readers who tells someone they are loved... and while that's 
reason enough, her appeal also made me think about how infrequently I tell 
those I care about, just how much I care about them. 

So, for the people ***you*** love: let 'em know! And don't forget about Haiti.
