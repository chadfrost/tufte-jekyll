[Joe Bageant: Mash Note for the "Girl with the 
Leash"](http://www.counterpunch.org/bageant06132004.html): "Most of the young 
soldiers were fleeing economically depressed places, or dead end jobs like 
Lynndie had at the chicken processing plant. These so-called volunteers are 
part of this nation's de facto draft---economic conscription. Money is always 
the best whip to use on the laboring       clasess. Thirteen hundred a month, 
a signing bonus and free room and board sure beats the hell out of yanking 
guts through a chicken's ass."
