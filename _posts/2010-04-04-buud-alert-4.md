This is Bicycle-Unfriendly Urban Design (BUUD) alert #4! 

*Location:* Portola Road (Westbound) at Farm Rd., Portola Valley CA 

*Issue:* Bike lane squeezes from usable width (4 ft?) to zero width, 
entering left-hand corner at bottom of hill, on a route popular with groups of 
cyclists ***and*** known for the local population being intolerant of cyclists 
using the lane... this recent re-striping (not visible in Google Maps as of 
this writing) seems designed to provoke bicycle-car conflict. Given the amount 
of bike traffic this route ("The Loop") gets, and the consistently wide 
shoulder everywhere else, this re-striping is ill conceived. 

It appears that the re-striping was performed to accommodate the addition of a 
left-turn lane. 

*Solution:* Put it back the way it was, let the cars wait a moment to get 
around those who must turn left. 

I'll post some photos next time I'm out that way.
