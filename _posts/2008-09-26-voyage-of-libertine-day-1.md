I'm aboard my friend Will's sailboat, *Libertine*, in Oyster Point marina 
(South San Francisco) -- we are leaving this morning for a journey down the 
California coast, to the Channel Islands and back. With Will as the captain 
and Coleen, Alan and myself as crew, we will be on the water for the next 6 or 
7 days; next stop is planned to be Port San Luis. I will post updates as 
connectivity permits! We should be underway by 10 this morning.
