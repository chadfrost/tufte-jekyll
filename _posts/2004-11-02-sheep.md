Well, it's looking like Ohio and Florida will both go to Bush, putting the 
presidency out of reach for Kerry.  I haven't seen a poll site yet that got 
all the key states right; neither 
[right](http://www.electionprojection.com/elections2004.html)-leaning nor 
[left](http://www.electoral-vote.com/)-leaning. I hope _all_ the polls are 
wrong enough that Kerry comes out ahead when all the counting is truly 
complete, but that sounds like a pipe dream just at the moment. 



Poor Tom Brokaw sounds like he wants to cry, describing the nearly-lost cause 
of the Kerry campaign. At the moment, Kerry would have to win every remaining 
state, including Nevada, and that just ain't going to happen. 



But what I just can't comprehend is Florida going to Bush!  Didn't the 
democrats in that state learn anything in 2000? 



And what about the "nation's breadbasket" -- what part of "giant deficit", 
"incipient draft", and "disingenuous foreign policy" do those people not 
understand?  Never mind, it's a rhetorical question.  The very people who vote 
for Bush are those who will suffer the most under his policies. 



Bunch of sheep, those folks.
