We departed Port San Luis at 3 am, and headed out under brilliant  starry 
skies... We found a pretty calm and relatively flat sea, and  made our way 
down the coast. Chad caught a fish, but it escaped as we  were netting it. 
Not 30 minutes later, though, we hooked another one  and managed to keep 
this one - even bigger than yesterday&#39;s fish! We  will be eating well  
for a few more days now (not that we weren&#39;t  eating well to begin 
with!)

We passed by Vandenberg AFB and could easily see the space launch  
facilities from an unusual perspective; we then passed several oil  
platforms -there aren&#39;t too many left on the California coast, but we  
saw most of them pretty closely. After passing point Arguello, we made  
for San Miguel island. Along the way, the wind picked up, and we  
regularly were seeing 8-9 knots as the swell helped us along.  
Fortunately, the crew seems to have become inured to the motion of the  
boat, and we could easily eat and tend to chores.

Approaching the 
island, we saw whales (blue whales we think) up pretty  close! We reached 
the anchorage around 5 pm, and while it&#39;s very  pretty, the wind is 
howling -- we&#39;ll be keeping a close eye on the  anchor 
tonight.
