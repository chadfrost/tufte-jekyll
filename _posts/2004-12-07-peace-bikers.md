A [tale](http://www.wildfermentation.com/mytaleofzerotolerance.htm) of zero 
tolerance: "for me it’s less about protesting bush, per se, than about public 
space and the methods of social control. in a world where property ownership 
is god and real estate determines culture, public space is precious. that is 
where people can congregate without some specific authorized purpose. do we 
want to live in a world where we need permission to gather? i sure don’t."
