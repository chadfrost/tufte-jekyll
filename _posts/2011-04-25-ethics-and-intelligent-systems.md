This isn't by any means a new topic; Asimov codified it in his famous [Three 
Laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics) back in 1942; and 
Wired ran [an article](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.01/view.html) in 
2005 that considered some of the broader ethical implications of introducing 
ever-more-humanoid machines into society.

There now seems to be a burgeoning discussion on this topic, spread widely. 

Illah Nourbakhsh's lecture (below) has spawned a [CMU class](http://ethic0sandrobotics.posterous.com); [Patrick Lin](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/node/6571) (along with George Bekey and others) at Cal Poly SLO's [Ethics + Emerging Technology Group](http://ethics.calpoly.edu/) have authored several good papers, with some intro and discussion at the [Stanford Law Center for Internet and Society](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/node/6625).  There are several interesting blogs covering this area, such as [moral machines](http://moralmachines.blogspot.com/).
