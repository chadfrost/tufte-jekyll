It seems like refreshing our familiarity with the Constitution, and the 
principles upon which it was written, is in keeping with the times.  The 
[Founders' 
Constitution](http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/tocs/toc.html) is a 
massive reference work, formerly available only as a multi-volume printed set, 
but now accessible electronically.  It's going to take me a while to get 
through it, but I'm going to try, with the hope that I will emerge with more 
than a passing familiarity with this important work.
