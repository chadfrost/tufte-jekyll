Well, I've been horribly negligent in keeping this up to date.  I think that's 
mostly because I've been maintaining the weblog as pure HTML, so posting has 
been less spontaneous than I would like.  I kept thinking that I would build a 
web-based content manager, but that kept getting pushed down the ever-growing 
stack of "wanna-do's". 

So, I've finally given in -- as long as [blogger](http://www.blogger.com) is 
free and does what I want, I'm going to join the unwashed masses and use it.  
The key for me was discovering that blogger supports secure transfer to my 
server. 

With any luck and a modicum of diligence on my part, you'll see more regular 
posts here!
