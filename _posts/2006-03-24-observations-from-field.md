<p class="mobile-post">I found this note I made in May of 2001:</p><p 
class="mobile-post">I have seen more people muttering in Washington D.C. than 
any other 
place I can remember -- They look normal, but you can see their lips 
moving as they walk along.  Some of them you can hear, engaging in a 
public dialog with themselves.</p>
