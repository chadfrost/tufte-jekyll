Kind of cool -- [Airship Ventures](http://www.airshipventures.com/) is 
bringing their new Zeppelin NT airship to be based at Moffett, and it should 
be arriving some time this weekend. I really like their [size comparison 
chart](http://www.airshipventures.com/comparison.php), which includes a giant 
squid!  One-hour flights are a bit pricey at ~$500, but what a fun experience 
it would be!  You can follow the progress of the airship on [their 
blog](http://airshipventures.blogspot.com/), which features lots of nice 
low-altitude photos.
