Back in the day, I knew a fellow, Sheldon, who would come on our training 
rides sometimes. He was a few years older than the rest of us, he had raced as 
a top amateur (a "Cat 1" on a name-brand team).  Several years into his 
cycling career, he developed bad allergies and "retired" from racing to go 
back to school and get a degree. Sheldon would say to us: "I don't train 
anymore - I just ride." And that's what he did; he wasn't trying to get 
faster, or peak for an event. He had nothing to prove to anyone, and perhaps, 
especially, to himself. So Sheldon simply rode, and enjoyed the time he spent 
on the bike, and he was *still* faster than most any of the rest of us on any 
given day. 

There's a lesson to be learned from Sheldon, applicable to more than just bike 
racing.
