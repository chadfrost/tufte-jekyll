Inspired by a posting on my [brother's 
blog](http://www.frostopolis.com/flog/archives/2005/10/17/000110.html), I 
finally found some information about the old, manual, portable typewriter I 
inherited from my Grandfather... [this 
site](http://staff.xu.edu/~polt/typewriters/rem-portables.htm) lists a 
plethora of information about the old Remingtons, from which I learned that I 
have a model 5 (boxy), made ca. Oct. 1932- Aug. 1939.
