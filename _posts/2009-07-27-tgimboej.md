I received one of The Great Internet Migratory Boxes of Electronics Junk 
([TGIMBOEJ](http://tgimboej.org/)) not long ago. The concept behind TGIMBOEJ 
is simple: put a bunch of stuff, suitable for using in an electronics project, 
in a box. Mail said box off to an eager recipient. Recipient takes some stuff 
out, puts some stuff in, and sends the Box off to the next recipient. Hilarity 
ensues :-)

One additional requirement of participation in the TGIMBOEJ project is 
documentation -- hence this post, and future ones on what gets made out of the 
junk (search on keyword 'tgimboej' to find them all.) 

As it turns out, [Evil Mad Scientist Labs](http://www.evilmadscientist.com/), 
the instigators of TGIMBOEJ, have located their lair conveniently down a bike 
path from my house. When the Mad Scientists contacted me to see if I wanted a 
box, I took a ride over there and brought it home strapped to the back of my 
bike. 

Here's what was in it:

"What a great opportunity to get rid of some of your useless crap that's been 
cluttering up the house" said^H^H^H^H thought my lovely wife -- so the box 
will depart here containing more junk than it arrived with. 

The box now goes to one [John Foster](http://www.johnpla.net/) -- who was 
selected for his appreciation of beer, spacecraft, and geekery. Have fun with 
it, John!
