I recently purchased some rather expensive, supposedly invincible tires for my 
commute / touring bike. The Schwalbe Marathon Supremes are acclaimed as about 
the most indestructible tire out there, short of a couple truly massive things 
that really aren't much fun to ride on. 

Now, if you ever found yourself asking, as I have, "Self, just what 
***would*** it take to puncture one of these tough tires?" I can now provide 
an answer.

Very pointy, kinda short, big flat head for maximum leverage... went right in 
through the middle of the tread, all the way to the head. Psssssssshhhhhhh....
