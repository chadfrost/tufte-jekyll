I just ran across [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/), and it's 
brilliant. Go look. Now. 

They also have a [blog](http://blog.kickstarter.com/). 

Basic idea: provide a "funding platform for artists, designers, filmmakers, 
musicians, journalists, inventors, exploreres..." that lets said creative 
folks offer up a concept, solicit contributions, and if a threshold amount is 
achieved, launch the project. There are some great (and some greatly kooky) 
projects at Kickstarter!
