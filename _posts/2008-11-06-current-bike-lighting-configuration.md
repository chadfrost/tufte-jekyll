Here's what I currently have as a winter time visibility kit: 

{% maincolumn 'assets/img/lights-all.jpg' 'An assortment of lights' %}

{% maincolumn 'assets/img/lights-tail.jpg' 'My favorite is the NiteRider taillight!' %}

NiteRider 15W halogen on handlebars, with sibling NiteRider taillight, both 
running off my home-made 12V NiMH battery pack on the back of the seat tube. I 
just got this working again after a 2-year hiatus, so there are some other 
headlights still on the bike until I'm confident in the new battery.

Big Cateye (HL-500 Opticube) on the left fork -- also currently a backup. 

{% maincolumn 'assets/img/lights-fork.jpg' 'Fork mount puts the light where it can best illuminate obstacles and debris on the road.' %}

NiteIze [SpokeLit](http://www.niteize.com/productdetail.php?category_id=26&product_id=163) 
on the front wheel -- it's a very bright green, highly visible and unusual, I 
really like it! 

Blackburn taillight on back of helmet - this thing is *bright*! Between it 
and the NiteRider taillight, I get frequent comments from other riders when 
they come up behind me at stoplights, such as "wow those are really visible!" 

{% maincolumn 'assets/img/lights-helmet.jpg' 'I got lucky with the mounting, in that it worked perfectly with this helmet.' %}

I also have a Planet Bike Superflash; it was mounted on the seatpost (where 
the NiteRider is now) but it's currently a backup and living in my commute 
bag.
