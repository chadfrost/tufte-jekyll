An interesting [point of 
view](http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/) from Tim Bray: 
"...if you want to develop software, you can build for the Web and/or Unix 
and/or OSS platforms; or alternatively, you can be a sharecropper."  Given 
that we're now using web-hosted apps at work for numerous things, the 
popularity of Blogger, Tax Act and the like, plus the increasing presence of 
high-speed internet, I think he may have a point.
