Quite brilliant, passed on by my friend Dave:

An American Self-Portrait 

Running the Numbers looks at contemporary American culture through the austere 
lens of statistics. Each image portrays a specific quantity of something: 
fifteen million sheets of office paper (five minutes of paper use); 106,000 
aluminum cans (thirty seconds of can consumption) and so on. My hope is that 
images representing these quantities might have a different effect than the 
raw numbers alone, such as we find daily in articles and books. Statistics can 
feel abstract and anesthetizing, making it difficult to connect with and make 
meaning of 3.6 million SUV sales in one year, for example, or 2.3 million 
Americans in prison, or 32,000 breast augmentation surgeries in the U.S. every 
month. 

This project visually examines these vast and bizarre measures of our society, 
in large intricately detailed prints assembled from thousands of smaller 
photographs. Employing themes such as the near versus the far, and the one 
versus the many, I hope to raise some questions about the role of the 
individual in a society that is increasingly enormous, incomprehensible, and 
overwhelming.
