Last we heard from the intrepid sailors, they had put in to Stillwater  
Cove... The story resumes:

We set sail in the morning, figuratively 
speaking; the skies remained  grey, and winds very light. Mercifully, the 
swell was much smaller and  easier, and the fog higher, so although we 
spent most of the day and  the following night under motor-power, we were 
able to eat and  function pretty well.

We caught a fish on Sunday, a 
nice albacore, who gave us a delightful  dinner one night, lunch today, 
and another meal yet to come.

We saw lots of wildlife - some whales in the 
distance, many dolphins  and porpoises came racing over to play, including 
some at night  leaving glowing trails of bioluminescence in their 
wake.

This morning brought us past Moro Bay, and into Port San Luis by  
lunchtime. We anchored and had the aforementioned fish for lunch, then  
took the dinghy in to shore for a beer and a shower. We got the boat  
ready after dinner for the morning&#39;s passage to the Channel Islands -  
we will leave around 3 am, so as to arrive at San Miguel Island before  
tomorrow night.
