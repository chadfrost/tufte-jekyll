This post inaugurates what, unfortunately, will become a regular feature here 
on the blog. I see so many gratuitously bad and dangerous examples of the 
urban-bike interface that I decided I should: 

a) keep track of them, 
b) share awareness of the hazards with other cyclists, 
c) have a convenient place to which to refer public officials and planners 
when I 
d) make a habit of alerting said officials and planners to the dangers. 

The first example will be highlighted in the next post. You will be able to 
find all the related posts by searching on "buud" or "bike danger".
