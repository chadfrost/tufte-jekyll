If bikes had bumpers on which to stick things, I would plaster mine with some 
of the following phrases, inspired by innumerable micro-moments I've 
experienced while commuting back and forth to work. The sub-title to this 
could be "Retorts to the (mostly unsaid) thoughts of car-drivers, as implied 
by their driving and/or emotive glares from behind the windshield." 

1) "Thanks, but I *do* own a car; I choose to bike instead." 
2) "I sure hope you weren't planning to apply for a job from me (yes, I'm 
hiring!)" 
3) "Why no, I do not believe your [penis|breasts] appear larger when you 
[insert sophomoric car-driving action here]." 
4) "Yes, thanks, I do like to think I own the road (at least the tiny piece 
I'm occupying, over here on the edge of it.)" 
5) "I'm sorry, I didn't notice that your [Hummer|Porsche|BMW|PoS] is secretly 
an [emergency vehicle|tank|starship|jet fighter]." 
6) "So exactly what part of my six blinking lights, bright yellow vest, and 
innumerable reflectors did you not see?" 

Feel free to tack "you selfish pork-face" on the end of any of these!
