Some amazing LEGO stuff: [ASL's LEGO 
Page](http://www.lipsons.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/lego.htm) has M.C. Escher 
recreations... 

<p> 

[Eric Harshbarger](http://www.ericharshbarger.com/lego/) has forged a career 
of Lego art/sculpture... 

<p> 

[Jennifer Clark](http://www.telepresence.strath.ac.uk/jen/lego/) has the most 
detailed and documented creations I think I've ever seen... 

<p> 

And for good measure: the [LEGO user's group](http://www.lugnet.com/). 

<p> 

I may just have to go buy some bricks...
