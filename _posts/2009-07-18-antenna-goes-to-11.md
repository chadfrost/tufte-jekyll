The amplified "digital TV" antenna I bought last year has never performed very 
well in our house; the signal level varies a lot, and is often so low that the 
station is lost for minutes at a time. I tried an experiment quite a while 
back, and ran a cable up to the roof; I stood up there pointing the antenna 
around to see if altitude and a really clear line of sight helped any. The 
results weren't encouraging.

I finally decided to do something about the situation (e.g. basically 
unwatchable TV) when I came across [this article from 
Make](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2009/01/maker_workshop_pdf_dtv_antenna.html) 
on an easy-to-build antenna design. I had most of the parts already lying 
around the garage, and a quick trip to OSH got me the rest for about $5. 

Testing in the house showed that the home-brew antenna performed just about as 
well as the amplified antenna -- but that still wasn't what I was hoping for. 
Today, I took the new antenna up on the roof, and the results were very good. 
Channels that used to be at signal strengths of 5-6 are now pegged at 10, and 
the fluctuation I used to see is gone. Success! 

My next step might be to cannibalize the old antenna to steal its amplifier...
